                              Studio Direct is an innovative model aimed towards assisting Emerging Artists with their transition into full-time studio practices.
<br> 
</h7>
<h3>
<br> Artists often struggle to find time to create work early on in their careers. Whether you’re working multiple part-time jobs, freelancing or teaching, there is always paid work that takes away from the time and energy you’re spending in studio. At the start of 2014, coming off of a primarily freelance design income, I asked 8 local Pittsburgh Art Patrons to assist me with this problem. 
<br> 
<br> The Studio Direct model has allowed me to have a thriving studio practice, garner new patrons, expand my professional network, feel confident with my pricing, all while preserving my current gallery relationships. I’d like to share it with other artists. Be inspired by this concept and make it fit with your own creative practice.

                              Through the Studio Direct model an artist pre-sells their work at a discounted rate to a select number of Patrons. These Patrons not only get a great deal, but also get to support an artist's studio practice for a year and be part of an intimate community of participants. The Artist recieves a stable foundation of income through the pre-sales, allowing for a more productive studio practice.

If this is budgeted out responsibly, you’ll be able to spend more time in your studio making artwork instead of taking on those extra shifts or freelance gigs.

                                       One of the best things Emerging Artists can do is meet new Patrons and stay in touch with old ones. This program gives you an excuse to reach out to people who you may have never met before as well as offer a nice discount to those Patrons who have already purchased your work. Over your yearlong partnership, you’ll build a closer relationship with Patrons old and new.

                                       Before Studio Direct I lacked the financial security to experiment in my studio. I was overly concerned with creating sellable work or was constantly scrambling to finish paintings for an upcoming exhibition. I had very little time to sketch and play with new ideas. 
                                       <br>
                                       <br>
                                       Once the program was underway I was able to focus on the eight purchased paintings while I planned out new directions for my work to go in. I spent nearly 4 months working the largest painting I had ever made. I could have never afforded to do that without the financial support of my Studio Direct Patrons.

                                       Through the program, your small group of Patrons are encouraged to introduce you to their personal network of friends and colleagues. They are supporting your art practice for an entire year because they believe in your work and will be excited to share it with others. Many of my Patrons visited my studio multiple times over the course of the year to introduce guests to my work.

                                       The final exhibition offers Patrons the best opportunity to show off their piece of artwork to others. They will invite new faces and make your guest list much more valuable.

                                       Some artists love the bartering side of selling artwork. I do not. Many artists undersell their work when they really need the money or overprice their work when a gallery has a steep commission. I believe you should stay as consistent with you pricing as possible. Studio Direct gives you a very valid reason to say no when people (or galleries) ask for discounts: You’ve already given your set amount for the year.

                                       I was initially concerned with how galleries may feel about the Studio Direct program because it functions outside of the normal art sales structure. In my experience, galleries have actually been impressed by the Studio Direct concept. I am upfront about the program with them and explain that it’s how I can afford to make the artwork that goes into their inventory. They’ve understood that and know in the long-run, the program increases my collector base and heightens the value of their inventory.
